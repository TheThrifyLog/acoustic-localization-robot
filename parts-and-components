# Parts and Components

This document summarizes key hardware components used in the acoustic localization robot prototype, along with rationale and lessons learned. The full bill of materials is provided in `parts-list.xlsx`.

## Mobility & Chassis
- **Tracked Tank Chassis**
  - Selected for stability and terrain adaptability
  - Easy to integrate with 3D-printed modifications
  - Limitation: hobby-grade materials not suitable for extreme temperatures

## Motors & Drivetrain
- **DC Gear Motors**
  - Provided sufficient torque for prototype testing
  - Audible PWM harmonics observed; mitigated via frequency tuning
  - Would re-evaluate for production-grade duty cycle

## Sensors
- **Electret Condenser Microphones**
  - Chosen for simplicity and availability
  - Direction estimation performance was strong
  - Distance estimation limited by geometry and noise sensitivity

## Compute & Control
- **Arduino Microcontroller**
  - Reliable for real-time motor control and signal sampling
  - Adequate for prototype; companion computer recommended for scaling

## Power
- **Battery System**
  - Suitable for proof-of-concept
  - Known limitations in cold environments
  - Future iterations may explore hybrid or alternative architectures

## Mechanical Fabrication
- **PLA 3D-Printed Parts**
  - Enabled rapid iteration
  - Not suitable for harsh environments
  - Would transition to higher-temperature or reinforced materials
