## Hardware Design
Chassis, drivetrain, suspension, sensors, compute.

## Software Stack
Arduino, ESP-32, signal processing approach, future ROS2 path.

## Acoustic Localization Approach
Microphone configuration, direction vs distance strategy, limitations.

## Testing & Results
What worked, what didn’t, key measurements.

## Challenges & Lessons Learned
Engineering tradeoffs, failures, and fixes.

## Future Improvements
What you would do next with more time/resources.

## Media
Photos, videos, diagrams.
